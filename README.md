# Python-api-challenge

## An overview of the project and its purpose.
### It is a process that allows us to know the codes by integrating the maps, new tools, test the management, analyze different variants according to the location and the needs we have. Project in a real way and based on graphs what is the variance between one factor or another, it tells us the logic but through facts and data.

## Instructions on how to use and interact with the project.
### Know how to handle the data according to the API keys, the endpoints, the count of the cities according to their longitude and latitude that from there open us to know their wind speed, temperature... putting them approved according to the scatter plot and the r-value, the variance and their statistically proven difference. 

## At least one paragraph summarizing the efforts made in the project in relation to ethical considerations.
### At the beginning it was difficult to know how to handle the new tools, which entailed an effort that required tutoring and internet, according to the studies we realize general features in the world with random cities.
